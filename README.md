## Overview of Analysis
The Disaster Reporting Network, a nonprofit company that provides data and insight into disasters around the globe, is looking to build a visualization, or map, with interactive features to help provide insights into earthquake data. Using the latest GeoJSON data from U.S. Geological Survey website, a map is created to:
- have multiple styles of map views (Street view, Satellite view, and Dark View)
- display relevant data which can be toggled on and off as needed by the user (an all-earthquake data toggle, a major earthquakes-only toggle, and a tectonic plate lines toggle)
- include a legend to the bottom right, to help clarify the color coding of the earthquake data points, which are also sized based on the seriousness of the earthquake
- include info. on the magnitude and location of each earthquake
